### Code for Preferential Subsampling with SGLD

All code is written in `Python 3.7x` and the key list of module requirements are provided in `requirements.txt`.

Run `./setup.sh` to set up the `data/` folder. This will generate all synthetic data and download the real data used in this paper. 

The source code for both models and samplers can be found in the `src/` folder. 

All experiments can be found in the `experiments/` folder. Jupyter Notebooks for each experiment should be opened within their containing folder. Each experiment folder contains a `Description.txt` file which details the purpose of each notebook.
